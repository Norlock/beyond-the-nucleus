Some test app for ideas

## Roadmap board

## Elm integration

-   [x] Mirror components on Elm side
-   [x] Navigate throught Elm
-   [ ] Fix UI settings in Elm
-   [ ] Fix ports
-   [ ] Component interface ( activate / deactivate / idle )
-   [ ] Chapter interface ( activate / deactivate / idle )
-   [ ] Fix UI for Chapter transition / game transition
-   [ ] Board scroll -> to Elm

## Standard

-   [x] Logger (lets do it earlier going to use it all the time anyway)
-   [x] Pixi
-   [x] Pixi scroller
-   [x] Add PIXI factory, because there are too many options
-   [x] Container selector for animations
-   [x] Component has container reference (and will select unselect)
-   [x] Write protection against loops
-   [x] Chapter
-   [x] Component manager
-   [x] styling
-   [x] webpack dev (or alternative)
-   [x] Add lines between components
-   [x] Vimeo integration
-   [x] Better scroll speed calculations
-   [x] quick way to test chapter/components
-   [x] lazy loading of components
-   [x] Ability to pass a sub module to a module (selector in fn style)
-   [+-] Test component before adding to the chain
-   [x] Lazy load also backwards
-   [x] Mover lazy loading over to PartChain and outide MergePixiFlow
-   [ ] Disable inputHandler mini game
-   [ ] Goldray filter for turtle http://filters.pixijs.download/dev/demo/index.html
-   [x] Show hotkeys overlay (panning etc).
-   [ ] Deep see fish with light + https://pixijs.io/examples/#/gsap3-interaction/gsap3-filters.js
-   [ ] Graphical effects (fire, stars, rain, movement)
-   [ ] Tests
-   [ ] WASM -> chain calc functions and have some return at the end so you calc everything at once in rust
-   [ ] Think about different resolutions in relation with scroll offset or component placement

## Roadmap Kungfu

-   [ ] collision (and collision with jump/fall)
-   [ ] falling
-   [ ] jumping
-   [ ] movement LR
-   [ ] maybe fetch map from backend?
-   [ ] enemies
-   [ ] multiple grids, for background maybe
-   [ ] sounds
-   [ ] load config

### Not sure

-   [ ] Pixi focus move with the scroller.

From the ocean to zen maybe go deeper into the ocean and than to the surface again and towards zen temple near a river/lake.
